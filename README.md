## Work Packages

(From Original Proposal Summary. To be extended as the project progresses)

*  **Community/Technology Pillar (WP1, Lead: Cambridge)**: Assess the requirements of the UK AI research community through workshops regarding the deployment and use of hardware-optimized software stacks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) within a federated compute environment, covering diverse hardware including multiple CPU architectures (x86, ARM) and accelerators (Nvidia, Intel GPUs etc.).

*  **Technology Pillar (WP2, Lead: Bristol, Co-lead: Cambridge)**: Survey and evaluate the suitability and limitations of existing tools, platforms, and methodologies (e.g., Spack, EasyBuild, EESSI, vendor containers, general registries) for building, distributing, and managing hardware-optimised AI application containers.

*  **Technology Pillar (WP3, Lead: UCL, Co-lead: Cambridge)**: Conduct a detailed analysis of the key technical challenges inherent in creating and operating a federated, hardware-optimized AI container platform, including hardware detection, build complexity, dependency management, orchestration, security, and licensing.

*  **Governance Pillar (WP4, Lead: Cambridge, Co-lead: Bristol)**: Investigate potential architectural and governance models for such a federated service, considering aspects like contribution guidelines, maintenance, user interface etc.

*  **Technology/Community/Governance Pillar (WP5, Lead: Cambridge, Co-leads: Bristol, UCL)**: Produce a comprehensive feasibility report synthesising all findings (user requirements, technical challenges, existing solutions, potential models) to directly inform the NFCS roadmaps.

*  **Technology Pillar- Stretch Goal (WP5, Lead: Cambridge, Co-leads: Bristol, UCL)**: Perform a limited technical evaluation of selected existing tools or techniques relevant to hardware detection or build optimization on a small, diverse hardware testbed provided by partners
