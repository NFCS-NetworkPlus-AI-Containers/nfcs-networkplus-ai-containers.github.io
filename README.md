## Work Packages

(From Original Proposal Summary. To be extended as the project progresses)

*  **WP1: Community and Outreach (Technology Pillar)**: Assess the requirements of the UK AI research community through workshops regarding the deployment and use of hardware-optimized software stacks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) within a federated compute environment, covering diverse hardware including multiple CPU architectures (x86, ARM) and accelerators (Nvidia, Intel GPUs etc.).

*  **WP2: AI Software tools (Technology Pillar)**: Survey and evaluate the suitability and limitations of existing tools, platforms, and methodologies (e.g., Spack, EasyBuild, EESSI, vendor containers, general registries) for building, distributing, and managing hardware-optimised AI application containers.

*  **WP3: Hardware and Technical challenges (Technology Pillar)**: Conduct a detailed analysis of the key technical challenges inherent in creating and operating a federated, hardware-optimized AI container platform, including hardware detection, build complexity, dependency management, orchestration, security, and licensing.

*  **WP4: Governance (Governance Pillar)**: Investigate potential architectural and governance models for such a federated service, considering aspects like contribution guidelines, maintenance, user interface etc.

*  **WP5: Synthesis (Technology/Community/Governance Pillar)**: Produce a comprehensive feasibility report synthesising all findings (user requirements, technical challenges, existing solutions, potential models) to directly inform the NFCS roadmaps.

*  **WP5 Stretch Goal: Prototype**: Perform a limited technical evaluation of selected existing tools or techniques relevant to hardware detection or build optimization on a small, diverse hardware testbed provided by partners
